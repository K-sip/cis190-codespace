In this lab I learned that no matter how many times I try tar -xrf it will not work because it is suppose to be -xzf.
I also learned sleep is import and my children want to take it away from me.
Also typing in vi without autocorrect sucks, my typing fingers and brain have gotten lazy.
But seriously, I need to practice these commands more.  Luckly google is your friend and helps whenever I get stuck or want to figure out the best way to use commands together.
